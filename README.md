# My dotfiles

>My first i3 rice

As always, I don't recommend just copying stuff down if you wanna learn.<br>
Going through the docs and forums, the arch wiki, and taking inspiration or learning the syntax and usage from <br>
such dotfiles is the only way- atleast, that's how I worked. I think it's fairly beautiful tho, isn't it. :) <br>
But whatever it be, it's cool for me. I'm happy with it.<br><br>
